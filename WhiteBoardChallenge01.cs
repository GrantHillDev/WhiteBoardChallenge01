            //if (input / 3)//this didn't work because if statements only make use of conditionals that are Boolean in nature.... it's an integer division; not expressing a Boolean. Seems like it's a syntactic error, as the same idea can be applied here with the use of a modulus. I think it's because C# sees the iteration statement as an operation, and not as a Boolean.

            //    response = "fizz";
            //}
            //else if (input / 5 = 0)//doesn't make sense to change the input variable to a Boolean, because then it cannot be directly compared to integers... and therefore cannot also perform operations associated with them.
            //{
            //    response = "buzz";//this didn't work either because syntactically, the left-hand side of the iteration statement must be a variable, property, or indexer.

I'm thinking that because of the order in which this method's code was written, that this actually works, whereas it wouldn't have worked if the buzz word had been written into the first if statement (since the computer reads and interprets your code from top to bottom).
            }
